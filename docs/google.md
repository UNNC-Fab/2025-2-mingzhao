GNU General Public License 3.0 (GPL 3.0) was released by the Free Software Foundation (FSF) in 2007, aiming to make necessary updates to GPL 2.0, especially in response to the rapid development of modern open-source software and technologies. It introduced provisions regarding patents, Digital Rights Management (DRM), and "Tivoization." Compared to its predecessor, GPL 3.0 places greater emphasis on protecting the freedom of open-source software in a global context, while also strengthening legal protections for developers.

One of the key updates in GPL 3.0 is the patent licensing clause. In GPL 2.0, while software developers could freely distribute and modify code, there was no clear provision regarding patent licensing, which could result in developers facing patent infringement risks when modifying or using an open-source project. To address this, GPL 3.0 explicitly requires that if developers distribute software licensed under GPL and hold relevant patents, they must grant a license for those patents to other users to prevent patent infringement lawsuits. This clause not only strengthens the freedom of open-source software but also allows members of the open-source community to use, modify, and distribute code with greater confidence, without worrying about future legal disputes related to patents.

In addition to the patent clause, GPL 3.0 also introduces provisions concerning Digital Rights Management (DRM). As digital media became more widespread, many commercial companies adopted DRM technology to restrict users' freedom to use digital content. In the past, GPL 2.0 did not address DRM issues, leading to some open-source projects being embedded in commercial products with DRM restrictions that limited users' ability to modify and use the software. To prevent this "Tivoization" phenomenon, GPL 3.0 added provisions against DRM, explicitly stating that any hardware using GPL software must not employ DRM to prevent users from modifying and using the software. This clause greatly ensures users' freedom to modify open-source software and prevents hardware manufacturers from using software to disable or restrict users' ability to customize the software.

Moreover, GPL 3.0 also made improvements in license compatibility. Many open-source projects use different licenses, which can present challenges for integrating and collaborating across different software. GPL 3.0 updates this by offering more flexible license compatibility, making it easier to share code between different open-source licenses. However, due to the inclusion of stricter patent and DRM clauses, GPL 3.0's compatibility with some older open-source licenses (such as GPL 2.0 and Apache 2.0) may be affected. Nonetheless, GPL 3.0 remains a highly protective license for developers who wish to maintain software freedom.

However, GPL 3.0 also has its points of contention, particularly regarding its acceptance by commercial companies. Due to its explicit provisions on patent licensing, DRM restrictions, and Tivoization, commercial companies may choose to avoid GPL 3.0 because it restricts them from integrating GPL-licensed software into closed-source products. Compared to more permissive licenses like the MIT or BSD licenses, the stringent requirements of GPL 3.0 may seem restrictive to some companies, especially for closed-source software developers, as it may impose additional legal burdens and operational obstacles.

Nevertheless, the primary purpose of GPL 3.0 is undoubtedly to better protect the freedom of the open-source community and ensure that the use, modification, and distribution of software are not subject to unfair legal constraints. As open-source software continues to evolve into mainstream technology, GPL 3.0 not only provides legal safeguards for developers but also grants users broader freedoms, especially when facing patent disputes and DRM technologies. The updates in GPL 3.0 enable open-source software to continue to thrive in the modern technological environment, especially in protecting users' freedoms, providing a stronger legal foundation for the open-source movement.

In summary, GPL 3.0 is a comprehensive upgrade to GPL 2.0, enhancing the protection of modern open-source software freedoms, particularly regarding patents, DRM, and Tivoization. While it faces certain challenges in commercial applications, GPL 3.0 provides a more robust legal framework for the continued development of open-source and free software in the long term.
