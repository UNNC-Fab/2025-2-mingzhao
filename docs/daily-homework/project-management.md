# **Project Management**

---

## **1. Create a Repository**

To start, we need to **create a repository** on **GitHub** at [github.com](https://github.com).

  
Set the **repository name** first.

  
As we continue to create our repository, we need to set our **visibility** to **Public**, allowing Internet users to access it.

  
Be sure to include a **README file** in the repository, as this is where we can provide a comprehensive **project description**.

  
 *Complete creation.*

## **2. Member Invitation**

You can **invite team members** to your repository.

  
After inviting, you can **view the list of invited members** in the repository settings.

---

## **3. GitHub Settings**

Once members are invited, go to **Settings** to configure project permissions and collaboration options.

  
 *Complete the setup.*

  
 *Upload pictures here.*

  
 *View and manage images here.*

## **4. Upload Web Page**

Use **Clone**, **Pull**, and **Push** commands to manage your code locally and synchronize with GitHub.

  
When uploading, remember to **enter the page version name** clearly.

  
After confirming, **click to upload** your project.

  
Then you can **view it on your GitHub webpage**.

## **5. Home Page Code**

Here is the **code for the home page** (you can paste it here later).
