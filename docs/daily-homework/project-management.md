# Project Management
1.Creat a repository

To start,we need to create a repository to access github.com. Setting the repository name first,and as we continue to create our repository,we need to set our visibility to Public, allowing Internet users to access it. And be sure to include a README file in the repository,as this is where we can provide a comprehensive project description.
