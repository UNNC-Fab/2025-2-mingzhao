# Molding and Casting: Research & Practice

## 1. Understanding Processes

### 1.1 Existing Process: Injection Molding

**Injection Molding** is the most standard manufacturing process for producing plastic parts in large volumes.

- **Principle**: Thermoplastic pellets are melted and injected into a steel mold under high pressure. The material cools and solidifies into the final shape.
- **Key Features**: High precision, extremely fast cycle times (seconds), and low cost per unit for mass production.
- **Limitations**: High initial tooling cost (molds are expensive).

### 1.2 Latest Research: Freeform Injection Molding (FIM)

**Freeform Injection Molding (FIM)** is a hybrid technology bridging 3D printing and injection molding.

- **Innovation**: It uses **3D printed soluble resin molds**.
- **Process**:
    1. Print the mold shell using a specialized dissolvable resin.
    2. Inject standard thermoplastic into the printed mold.
    3. Dissolve the mold in a chemical bath, leaving only the complex part.
- **Advantages**: Allows for **complex geometries (undercuts)** that are impossible with traditional steel molds. Reduces prototyping lead time from weeks to hours.

## 2. Materials Study

### Material A: Polypropylene (PP)

- **Category**: Thermoplastic.
- **Processing Method**: Injection Molding.
- **Post-Processing**: Gate trimming, flash removal. Surface finish depends on the mold texture.
- **Effect**: Semi-crystalline, translucent or colored. Extremely flexible, fatigue-resistant (living hinges), and chemically resistant.
- **Application**: Food containers, automotive bumpers, flip-top bottle caps.

### Material B: Polyurethane Resin (PU Resin)

- **Category**: Thermosetting Polymer.
- **Processing Method**: Silicone Molding / Vacuum Casting.
- **Post-Processing**: Sanding parting lines, painting, or plating.
- **Effect**: Can range from rigid to flexible (rubber-like). Captures extreme surface detail from the silicone mold.
- **Application**: Prototypes, action figures, small-batch electronic housings.

## 3. Practical Operation Guide

### 3.1 Desktop Injection Molding Machine

*(Example: Manual or Semi-auto Benchtop Machine)*

1. **Setup**: Turn on the heating element. Set the temperature based on material (e.g., **PP at 230°C**). Wait 15-20 mins for full melting.
2. **Clamping**: Place the aluminum mold into the vise. **Tighten securely** to prevent flash (excess plastic leaking out).
3. **Injection**: Pull the lever or activate the motor to force plastic into the mold. Hold pressure for 10 seconds to compensate for shrinkage.
4. **Cooling**: Allow the mold to cool (air cooling). Unclamp and eject the part.

### 3.2 Silicone Molding & Casting

1. **Master Pattern**: Secure your master model in a leak-proof mold box (made of LEGOs or acrylic).
2. **Mixing Silicone**: Mix Silicone Part A and Part B by weight (e.g., 1:1 ratio). Stir thoroughly to avoid uncured spots.
3. **Degassing**: Place the mixture in a **Vacuum Chamber** to remove air bubbles. This ensures a smooth mold surface.
4. **Pouring**: Pour the silicone from a high point into the lowest corner of the box. Let it flow over the model naturally.
5. **Casting**: Once the mold cures, remove the master. Mix your PU Resin and pour it into the silicone mold. Wait for it to cure and demold.
