## **2.  About Arduino Uno**

**Arduino Uno** is the most commonly used development board in the Arduino family.
Below are its **main features and functions**:


- **Microcontroller:** Uses the **ATmega328P**, an **8-bit AVR microcontroller** with **32KB Flash memory**, **2KB SRAM**, and **1KB EEPROM**.


- **Clock Frequency:** Operates at a master clock speed of **16 MHz**, which ensures stable performance in most small-scale embedded applications.


- **Pin Configuration:**
- **14 digital pins** (D0–D13), among which **D0** and **D1** are used for **serial communication**.
- **6 analog pins** (A0–A5) for analog input.
- **6 pins** support **PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)** output.


- **Power Options:**
- Can be powered via **USB port** or **external power supply**.
- **Input voltage range:** 7V–12V, or via **VIN pin** for flexible input.


- **Communication Interface:**
- Has a **USB interface** for code uploading and PC communication.
- Supports **serial communication** for connecting with other devices.


- **Other Features:**
- Equipped with a **reset button** to restart the running program easily.
- Fully compatible with the **Arduino IDE** software environment, enabling convenient **code writing, compiling, and uploading**.
