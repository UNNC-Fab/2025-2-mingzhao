About the main features and functions of Arduino Uno:
Uses the ATmega328P, an 8-bit AVR microcontroller with 32KB Flash memory, 2KB SRAM, and 1KB EEPROM.
Clock frequency: The master clock frequency is 16MHz.  Pin configuration: has 14 numeric pins (labeled D0 to D13), where D0 and D1 are used for serial communication;  There are also six analog pins (labeled A0 to A5);  There are 6 pins that support PWM.
Power options: Power can be supplied via USB port or external power supply with input voltage range from 7V to 12V or with VIN pin.
Communication interface: Having a USB interface for uploading code and communicating with a computer or other device;  It also supports serial communication.
Other features: There is a reset button on the board for restarting the program;  Fully compatible with the Arduino IDE software environment, it makes writing, compiling and uploading code easy and convenient.
