## **3. Simple introduction to other CAD software**

### **SolidWorks**

SolidWorks is a 3D CAD (Computer-Aided Design) software developed by Dassault Systèmes. It is mainly used for mechanical and product design, but is also applied in civil engineering, architecture, and aeronautical design.

1. **Powerful 3D modeling features**: SolidWorks is known for its intuitive 3D design and product development tools, which can quickly produce high-quality 3D models.
2. **Simulation and validation**: SolidWorks includes a simulation toolkit that allows you to test your product designs before actual manufacturing, helping detect and solve potential problems in advance.
3. **Non-programming automation**: SolidWorks has powerful pattern and configuration tools that let you create similar but slightly different parts, which is useful for rapidly generating product families.
4. **Electrical and electronic systems design**: SolidWorks also offers tools for electrical and electronic system design, which are useful for projects involving complex wiring or electronic components.
5. **Integrated CAM system**: SolidWorks provides integrated CAM (Computer-Aided Manufacturing) tools, so you can plan how to manufacture parts on machine tools while you design the product.
6. **Wide range of applications**: SolidWorks is widely used in fields such as mechanical design, automotive design, electronic devices, medical equipment, industrial equipment, and mold manufacturing.

### **CATIA**

CATIA is a high-end 3D CAD software also developed by Dassault Systèmes. It is widely used in aerospace, automotive, shipbuilding, and other industries that require very complex products and large assemblies.

1. **Advanced surface modeling**: CATIA is especially strong at complex freeform surfaces, making it suitable for car body, aircraft fuselage, and other aerodynamic shapes.
2. **Large assembly management**: It handles very large and complex assemblies efficiently, which is important for airplanes, cars, and industrial machines.
3. **Multidisciplinary integration**: CATIA supports mechanical design, structural analysis, systems engineering, and even electrical and fluid systems, helping different engineering teams work in a unified platform.
4. **PLM integration**: CATIA is often used together with PLM (Product Lifecycle Management) systems, helping companies manage the whole life of a product from concept to retirement.
5. **Industry-standard in some fields**: In aerospace and automotive industries, CATIA is considered a standard tool and is required by many large companies.
6. **High learning and application value**: Although it is more complex and expensive than entry-level CAD tools, mastering CATIA is very valuable for engineers working in large industrial companies.

### **AutoCAD**

AutoCAD is one of the most widely used CAD software products developed by Autodesk, supporting both 2D drafting and basic 3D modeling.
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jasperxi0218/imageuploadservice/main/img/20251116152608297.png)
1. **Powerful 2D drafting**: AutoCAD is especially strong in 2D drawing, commonly used for mechanical drawings, architectural plans, and engineering documentation.
2. **Broad industry standards**: Many industries use DWG/DXF files as standard formats, so AutoCAD drawings are highly compatible and widely accepted.
3. **Basic 3D capabilities**: Although not as specialized in 3D as some other software, AutoCAD still supports 3D modeling for simple solids and surfaces.
4. **Rich plug-ins and vertical versions**: There are many specialized versions (such as AutoCAD Mechanical, AutoCAD Architecture) and third-party plug-ins for different industries.
5. **Flexible customization**: Users can customize commands and workflows using scripts and APIs (such as AutoLISP), improving efficiency.
6. **Cross-platform support**: AutoCAD offers desktop, web, and mobile versions, allowing users to view and edit drawings on different devices.
